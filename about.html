<p> I really wanted to created a website that is about the sea world.  I wanted the website to have the moving sea creatures.  My inspiration came from a website that you listed on blackboard, and also the direction of the sea creature moves inspired from Pacrownia website.  I think it is just so awesome that how creative and how the items moves on that webpage.  It took me a long time to figure out how to script it.</p>
<p>I love how to website turned out, and I like the animation of the waves and sea bubbles.  I did a lot of research, and also the project that I did for animation helped to understand a lot better of how to animated it.
